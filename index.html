<!--CODECADEMY:   Building Websites From Scratch
    UNIT:         08 (Days 1 - 7)
    PROJECT:      "Capstone Project: Colmar Academy"
    DESCRIPTION:
    You are tasked with designing and creating the landing page for a new school. You will help them by making informed design decisions about color and typography using the skills you learned last week. You will then implement your design.

    For this project we will provide you with wireframes. A wireframe is a document which contains the positioning of the elements on a page without specifying any other design information. This allows designers and developers to focus on the flow of a site without getting distracted with design decisions such as color and typography. These aspects of the design are important, but when they are introduced too early, they can detract from other important decisions.

    For this project you will implement the site specified by the wireframes and make all remaining design decisions to complete the site. You can find the wireframes for this project here (https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/freelance-1/capstone-2/colmar-academy-spec.png) and all of the necessary assets for the project here (https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/freelance-1/capstone-2/capstone_colmar_assets.zip).

    TOP TIPS:
      1. Key Mindset to all CSS postitioning problems:
            Important to break each component down into smaller components until you are working with a problem you've
            seen before and know how to solve. This mindset is the key to all CSS positioning problems.
      2. Debuggin:
            As you fix bugs, remember to use the skills you acquired in the Chrome DevTools article to help you decipher and update the site's CSS. Chrome DevTools are essential for debugging ; they allow you to view current style values, toggle rules, and test different rule values.
